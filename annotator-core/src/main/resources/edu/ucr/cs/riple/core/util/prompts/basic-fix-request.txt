I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "%s" and the full error message is: "%s".
The line with the error is: "%s".

The error is within "%s" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
%s
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "%s") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
If you can provide the fixed code snippet, provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
<response>
  <success>true</success>
  <code><![CDATA[
  ```java
  Your fixed code snippet here
  ```
    ]]>
  </code>
</response>
