For the reason you mentioned earlier:

"%s"

in the method below, the expression %s is not nullable at the point it is used.

```java
%s
```
Please Summarize the reason in max 5 words and rewrite the method so that at the line "%s", at the occurrence of: "%s" is replaced with `Nullability.castToNonnull(%s, summary of reason)`
Replace "REASON" with the exact reason summary I provide to you (maximum 5 words), not with a generic explanation like "checked to be nonnull".
see the example below, for expression `foo.getBar()`, to wrap it with `Nullability.castToNonnull(foo.getBar(), "reason")`.

```java
public t(){
    String l = foo.getBar();
}
```

will be:
```java
public t(){
    String l = Nullability.castToNonnull(foo.getBar(), "checked to be nonnull");
}
```
